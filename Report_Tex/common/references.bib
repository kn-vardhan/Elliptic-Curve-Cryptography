title = {Reducing elliptic curve logarithms to logarithms in a finite field, IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory}, 
year = {1993}, 
abstract = {Previously, no general-purpose algorithm was known for the elliptic curve logarithm problem
that ran in better than exponential time. In this
paper we demonstrate the reduction of the elliptic
curve logarithm problem to the logarithm problem
in the multiplicative group of an extension of the
underlying hit e field. For the class of supersingu-
lar elliptic curves, the reduction takes probabilis-
tic polynomial time, thus providing a probabilis-
tic subexponential time algorithm for the former
problem. The implications of our results to public key cryptography are discussed.}
